    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">I&rsquo;m a problem-solver. I enjoy puzzles, figuring things out, and improving things. I am also addicted to learning new things. In my professional life, I apply these traits to my career as a <span class="nbsp">front-end</span> web developer, occasional designer, and when-I-can UX meddler.</p>
    <h3>The Early Years</h3>
    <p>I have been in the web industry for a over 5 years now. I started out as an intern as a graphic designer, but when I got my first real job, our company needed someone to turn our designs in to real sites. I took it upon myself to learn how to build a web site quickly, teaching myself by reading blog posts, discussions on forums, and inspecting others people&rsquo;s code. I built the sites that I and my co-workers designed. Sometimes I built them correctly, sometimes I built them using hacks I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have, but each time I learned more and more. Each time I completed a project I took what I learned and put it towards the next project, building my skills <span class="nbsp">project-by-project</span>.</p>
    <h3>The Middle Years</h3>
    <p>When I went to my next job, I decided to dedicate myself to front-end development (though I still enjoyed doing design during my personal time and for freelance projects). This was around the time that the web standards revolution was kicking in to high gear, with a books by the likes of Jeffrey Zeldman and Andy Clarke changing the way most developers looked at the web. Again, I dived in to reading, exploring, and understanding these concepts and techniques&mdash;constantly trying to make each project better than the last.</p>
    <h3>The Current Years</h3>
    <p>When I moved on again, HTML5 and CSS3 were beginning see real-world adoption. And still I dived in to these subjects to understand how they could best be utilized to improve the quality of my work. I learned about Responsive Web Design and the Mobile First approach, all building on top of a Progressive Enhancement foundation. I also began to focus on user-centered design and user experience, working closely with Information Architects, UX Designers, Interaction Designers, and Visual Designers to create the best experience we could.</p>
    <h3>The Coming Years</h3>
    <p>These past few years have seen a rapid revolution in the understanding and use of the Internet in our lives. We've gone from table-based layout and IE6 to client-side web applications and in-browser games that run on our phones, desktops, and everything in between. But still there is more to learn. Monolithic JavaScript libraries like jQuery are giving way to light, task-specific libraries such as Backbone, Mustache, and Zepto. NoSQL solutions like MongoDB and server-side JavaScript with Node.js are finding their place in the world.</p>
    <p>More and more the web evolves, gaining the capabilities that designers and developers require to build products and experiences and enrich peoples&rsquo; lives. And so it will evolve, and our understanding of what the Internet is will evolve with it. And I can only hope that my skill, knowledge, and passion for this industry keeps pace.</p>
